	1.	Define float area(point a, point b, point c). It finds area of triangle ABC. [Find direction corresponding to AB and AC. 
		Now call cross product and magnitude]. Area of the triangle with end points (3,4,5), (7,3,6) and (6,2,3) is 6.36.
		
	2.	Write program, which reads two lines and finds the point of intersection. To accomplish it define a function point intersection 
		(line g, line h). e.g. Input 2x+3y-26=0 and 4x+7y-54=0 output (10,2).
		
	3.	Write program, which reads four points and finds the point of intersection of the line joining first two points and the last two points. 
		Let input points be (4,6), (-2,10), (10,2) and (3,6) then the point of intersection is (10,2). [Hint: use above functions]
		
	4.	Define function float distance (point p, line l). Using it write program, which reads a point and a line.
		The program, finds the distance of the point ‘p’ from the line ‘l’. e.g. input point (2,3) and 
		line 8x+6y-12=0 distance = (8*2+6*3-12)/(82+62)1/2 = 2.2.
		
	5.	Write program, which reads three points and finds the distance of first point from the line joining other two points. 
		[Hint: use functions to find equation and distance]

Define  class circle {point c;float r;}; c is the center and r is radius.
	6.	void print(circle x). It prints the equation of the circle. Let x be a circle whose centre is (2,3) and radius is 7. 
		Call to a function circle(x) will output x2+y2-4x-6y-36=0. It is because (x-2)2+(y-3)2=72 is the equation of the circle. 
		
	7.	circle form(float g,float h,float k). x=form(-4,-6,-36) will make a circle whose centre is (2,3) and radius is 7.
	
	8.	float chord length(circle a,line b). It returns the length of the chord corresponding to circle ‘a’ and line ‘b’.
		If a circle has centre (1,2) and radius 5 and the line is 5x+12y+10=0 then chord length is 8.
		[Method: find distance (d) between centre and line by using appropriate function call now use (r2-d2)1/2.] 
		Assume that the line intersects with the circle.
		
	9.	float intersection(circle a, float b). It returns the y-coordinate of point of intersection of circle (s) and line (x=b). 
		Let a circle (s) has centre (7,2) and radius 5. y=intersection(s,10) will make y as 6 (or -2). 
		It is because circle (x-7)2+(y-2)2=52 intersects with the line x=10 at points (10,6) and (10,-2).
		
	10.	Write program, which reads a number and finds (sum of digits) smallest factor. If number is 455 then output is 145. 
		[Sum of digits, smallest factor, power] 
		
	11.	Define function  int join(int x, int y). It joins numbers x and y. join(273,4167) returns 2734167.
	
	12.	Define function  int replace(int x, int y). The first digit of the number is replaced by y. replace(27349,5) returns 57349.
